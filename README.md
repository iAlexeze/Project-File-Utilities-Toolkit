## File Backup<a name="file-backup"></a>
The **File Backup** module offers a seamless way to safeguard your precious data. With just a simple command, you can create a backup of your files and store them securely in the "backup" directory. You can also specify the date for added organization, making data retrieval a breeze. Don't risk losing your files; back them up with ease!

## File Content Filter<a name="file-content-filter"></a>
In the **File Content Filter** module, you have the power to filter out specific content from your files. With the help of the "filter.txt" and "keyword.txt" files, you can customize the filtering process to your needs. This module is perfect for refining your data and extracting only the relevant information.

## File Encryption and Decryption<a name="file-encryption-and-decryption"></a>
Protect your sensitive files with the **File Encryption and Decryption** module. Use the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm to safeguard your data from prying eyes. Choose your encryption key and secure your files effortlessly. And fear not, you can easily decrypt them back to their original form whenever you need!
